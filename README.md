# Epicodus Project | Week 13 | Multiplayer Grid API

The plan of this project is to have the following functionality:
- Allow users to sign in and create a player in the game
- Allow users to change the color of their character
- Allow a logged in user to see a grid map with all currently logged in players visible
- Allow a user to move to a different tile on this map, and update the view for all other players
